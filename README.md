# TODO
- Fix API enable (cannot connect to host modem when in transparent mode). Must set in XCTU.
- Change line ending transmission/receive type (for each terminal).
- Update help with new features (copy/paste, labels).
- Write current settings to non-volatile storage on host modem.
- Log terminal output to file (for the moment you can use the named pipe and an external program like Putty to do this).
